The principal product of the course will be a student team-generated grant proposal. The topic this year will be the design of experiments that probe unique aspects of the biochemical networks associated with apoptosis. Students will prepare for their topic both out of class and in class during recitations (we plan to teach three hours per week and reserve about one hour for discussion). After each framing session, students will go to the literature and flesh out their ideas as topics for a grant proposal. They will present their ideas to the class in Power Point format during the framing sessions. After the ideas are fleshed out, the students will jointly write their grant proposal. Each student will write a section of the proposal that will be identified as their own.
